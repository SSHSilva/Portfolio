      <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I am currently on an exciting journey to become a Full Stack Engineering. I have started by learning HTML and CSS, and I am now diving into JavaScript to make websites more dynamic and interactive.

      My interest in programming goes back to my university days, where I studied C++ and Java. Although my major was in Management, I always felt a strong pull toward technology and problem-solving. Over time, that passion only grewâ€”and I realised it was not too late to follow it.

      So, I made a bold decision to pursue what truly excites me: becoming a professional programmer. Every day, I am building on my skills, exploring new technologies, and enjoying the challenge of creating things that live on the web.
      </p> 

      <h3>My Mission</h3>
      <p>To become a skilled, confident full stack developer and build meaningful applications that solve real-world problems. I am excited to keep growing, keep learning, and eventually join a team where I can make an impact.</p>
